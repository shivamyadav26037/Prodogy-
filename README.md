### Task 1: Average House Price by Number of Bedrooms
 Objective
Analyze the relationship between the number of bedrooms in a house and its average price using a dataset of housing information.

 Description
In this task, we:
Loaded a housing dataset from a CSV file.
Grouped the data based on the number of bedrooms.
Calculated the average house price for each bedroom group.
Visualized the results using a bar chart.

###Task 2: Titanic Dataset Analysis
 Objective
Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and relationships in passenger data â€” such as survival rates by gender, class, and age â€” and visualize these patterns using statistical plots.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Overview:
Used .info() and .describe() to understand column types, null values, and summary statistics.
Identified missing values using df.isnull().sum().
